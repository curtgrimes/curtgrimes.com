            I am a full-stack web developer living in the northern Illinois
            area. Currently, I have been working a lot with
            <em>JavaScript</em>, <em>Node.js</em> and <em>Vue</em>. My latest
            project is <a href="#web-captioner">Web Captioner</a>, a
            speech-to-text service.

            I am passionate about design that is intuitive and satisfying for my
            users. I think a lot about using the right tool for the job and
            writing software that is maintainable and robust.
