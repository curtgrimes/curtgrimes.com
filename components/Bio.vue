            I am a full-stack web developer living in the northern Illinois area.
            Currently, I have been working a lot with
            <em>JavaScript</em>,
            <em>Node.js</em> and
            <em>Vue</em>. My latest project is
            <a href="#">Web Captioner</a>, a speech-to-text
            service.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am passionate about design that is intuitive and satisfying for my users. I think a lot
            about using the right tool for the job and writing software that is maintainable and robust.
