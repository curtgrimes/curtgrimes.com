# Curt Grimes Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)-based portfolio website. See it live at [https://curtgrimes.com](https://curtgrimes.com).

In production, I deploy this website to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) using the [@nuxtjs/vercel-builder](https://nuxtjs.org/docs/2.x/deployment/vercel-deployment) package.

## Development

1. Run `npm install`
   - You'll need the `FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` env variable set, or you can remove `.npmrc` and the Font Awesome pro dependency to install dependencies without a Font Awesome Pro license.
1. Run `npm run dev`

See [further instructions for developing with Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/commands/), which is the framework this project is based off of.
