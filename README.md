# Curt Grimes Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/)-based porfolio website. See it live at https://curtgrimes.com.

In production, I deploy this website to [ZEIT](https://zeit.co) using the [@nuxtjs/now-builder](https://nuxtjs.org/faq/now-deployment/) module.

## Development

1. Run `npm install`
   - You'll need the `FONTAWESOME_NPM_AUTH_TOKEN` env variable set, or you can remove `.npmrc` and the Font Awesome pro dependency to install dependencies without a Font Awesome Pro license.
1. Run `npm run dev`

See [further instructions for developing with Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/guide/commands/), which is the framework this project is based off of.
